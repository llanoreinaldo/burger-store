### Overview

I have created The Bonkers Burger Store using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Following an MVC design pattern; this site uses Node and MySQL to query and route data into the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.  The site is deployed using Heroku. 


### About The Bonkers Burger Store

* The Bonkers Burger Store! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The Bonkers Burger Store app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
